    "#### Method 1: Generating spikes directly\n",
    "Simulating a Poisson process with estimated firing rate $r_{est}(t)$: proceed through time in intervals of $\\Delta t$, probability of generating a spike at time $t_i$ should be $r_{est}(t_i)\\Delta t$. Generate some $x_\\text{rand}$ with a uniform dist. and depending on that value, decide whether to have a spike or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) No refractory period with this model, but this can be solved by setting the firing rate to 0 immediately after a spike, and letting it return to its predicted value with something like exponential recovery (or a different model for recovery).\n",
    "\n",
    "To comparing a histogram of observed interspike interval data with a histogram of isi data generated froma. Poisson model, there's generally a discrepancy for shorter intervals (less than about 10 ms), due to the refractory period that the Poisson process doesn't account for. The gamma dist. has been shown to fit better than the Poisson (exponential) model:\n",

    "#### Using the Fano factor\n",
    "1) Run lots of trials to create a probability distribution for the likelihood of $n$ spikes in a trial ($n$ on the x-axis).\n",

    "2) Find the variance and mean of that dist. Repeat that many times until you can get a scatterplot of variance (spikes$^2$) vs. mean (spikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fit the data to the equation $\\sigma_n^2=A\\langle n\\rangle^B$. If A and B are really close to 1, then the Fano factor is really close to 1, so a Poisson model is probably somewhat accurate. Also apparently anesthetized animals have more variable response than alert animals, so experiments (usually conducted on anesthetized animals) show more variation than you would normally expect.\n",

    "#### Using the coefficient of variation (isi distribution)\n",
    "1) From the spike trains of neurons (from area MT and V1 neurons of monkeys, in this case), get the std and mean of ISIs for each trial, and calculate $C_V$ for each trial.\n",

    "3) Temporal coding vs rate coding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independent-spike code\n",
    "Spike generation can be described as an inhomogeneous Poisson process, so probability of a spike only depends on $r(t)$ and all stimulus info that is possible to gather can be extracted from $r(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation code (still a single neuron)\n",
    "Spikes do not encode independently. Ex: if interspike intervals encoded significant info, spike times relative to overall oscillation rhythm of a group of neurons in an area (rat hippocampus)\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have shown that correlations usually don't encode more than 10% of the independent-spike code (these studies might not have examined all possible information, but it's a good enough reason to focus models on independent spikes, which is simpler).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal coding (unrelated to the indepedent-spike coding vs. correlation coding issue)\n",
    "Neural response times (ex. precise spike timing, high-frequency firing-rate fluctuations) encode significant information, and such temporal precision is not only directly caused by changes in the stimulus (even though the end result is that it encodes something about the stimulus).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's a temporal code if the temporal resolution of spikes is more precise than that of the stimulus (details of spike timing require a scale shorter than the fastest time characterizing variations in the stimulus)."
