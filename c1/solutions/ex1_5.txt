For a constant rate Poisson process, every specific (up to a finite
resolution) sequence of N spikes occurring over a given time interval
is equally likely. This seems paradoxical because we certainly do not
expect to see all N spikes appearing within the first 1% of the time
interval. Resolve this paradox.

Answer:
Every sequence of N spikes occurring over a given time interval T is 
equally likely, but we don't expect to see all N spikes appearing 
within the first 1% of the time interval. 
This isn't a paradox because if you restrict the spikes to be in the 
first 1% of the given time interval, you're changing the time interval 
being used to a smaller length, so the probability of N spikes in that 
smaller intervals is much lower. 
Getting any specific sequence of N spikes in T is just as unlikely as 
getting all N spikes in the first 1% of the interval, but the probability 
that the N spikes is in the first 80% of the interval (for example) is 
higher since the restricted interval is larger.
